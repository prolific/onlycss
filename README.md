### Ideology

* We **do not** support no code movement. We think everyone should know how to write css if they are working with frontend.
* The purpose of the core framework is to provide you with only the **usual** css required to build a complete website from scratch.
* For special cases that depends on site to site, we recommend writing your own css classes. Framework is fully customizable so overriding the variables for the respective custom class should do the trick in most cases.
* The concept of CSS variables is used in such a way that you can customize the entire framework by just configuring a few variables.
